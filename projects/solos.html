            <div class="description">
                Examining the current competitive landscape, we observed Hinge and Tinder emerging as prominent platforms facilitating connections among like-minded individuals. Meanwhile, platforms like Meetup primarily cater to local event participation, albeit often geared toward group outings. In contrast, SOLOS presents a distinctive proposition: a platform fostering genuine connections with minimal commitment, coupled with the opportunity for collaborative exploration in new destinations.
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                Since our platform was also founded on the notion of pairing people with similar interests together, one question that kept coming up was, "How is this different from a dating app?" We made the key decision early on to make this an event-based, rather than people-based platform, to prioritize the act of exploring a new city with someone, rather than emphasizing personality traits about who that person was.

                    As an avid traveler, it was extremely fulfilling to work on a project in which I could envision myself using in the future. Not only was I able to learn immensely about designing disruptive services, but I did so alongside a team of passionate designers, innovators, and travelers.

                    We went through a lot of iterations of wire framing, logo designing, color palette selection, app flow, etc. throughout our design process. However, through it all, we kept our ideas well documented. We really emphasized as a team that no idea was a bad idea. And just like traveling with SOLOS, no design process is ever done truly alone.
