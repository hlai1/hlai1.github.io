                This past summer I worked as a Software Engineering intern on Microsoft's Redmond Headquarter campus. Over the course of 12 weeks, I worked on a team within Azure Security to monitor the performance metrics of a re-architectured attestation service. My time at Microsoft involved presenting code for review to engineers, coffee chats with CVPs, designers, and product managers, and whiteboarding out ideas. In the final two weeks, I refined my design document, and also presented my achievements, learnings, and opportunities for future expansion in a slide deck to over 25 engineers, project managers, designers, and interns.

                        <span class="dark-green-font">Expanding my knowledge: </span>Attestation, security, and cloud infrastructure were all foreign concepts to me when I entered my internship in May. Beyond my project roadmap, I was able to delve deeper into the intricacies of these realms and how they impacted Microsoft's interaction with servers around the world, and how they were the foundation of processes like logins, credit cards, and passkeys. I was not just coding, I was encouraged to read books on software programming foundations, programming practices, and more. I was coffee chatting other developers, designers, and product managers to learn about their realms of work. My time at Microsoft was full of learning about the realm of what I could do with the potential around me.

                        <span class="dark-green-font">Building a new service:</span> Working on a team that was re-architecting an existing service was immensely exciting. I had the opportunity to see how developers on my team were debugging unexpected system errors and planning how to move forward with building out the service. I also got to realize the impact of my own project, testing code, and monitoring performance metrics in the development of the new service.

                        <span class="dark-green-font">Realms beyond technology:</span> beyond just doing my day-to-day work, I sought to understand the stories of people working in all different orgs within Microsot. I spoke to designers working on OneNote and Forza Motorsport, developers on XBox and Office, product managers on Azure. Learning about their experiences beyond college and at Microsoft helped me better understand my own strengths and weaknesses, as well as the realms of possibilities within and beyond the tech world.
