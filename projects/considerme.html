                Our solution aims to pinpoint bias or assumptions designers may be making from the start of the design process, so neither they nor their developers & entire organization waste time, energy, and money later on down the line. Consider Me, a Figma/Figjam add-on, allows designers to use their current board, problem statement, target user groups, as well as optional information such as demographics of the designers working on the project and users being interviewed, the goal of the project, to generate a list of considerations for the project team to focus on (e.g. “Consider older interview participants”).

                We initially wanted to utilize dense data to provide detailed design recommendations for designers. However, after our informal critique, we decided to shift from a high risk, high value solution to a low risk, user-driven solution for our MVP. This would ensure that our concept wasn't based around AI surpassing its current capabilities.

            <div class="description">
                Our original Figma concept took a more harsh approach when outputting changes to a designer’s Figma file. The concept was that designers would input demographic information about the team working on their project, as well as project details, so our Figma plugin could point out places they were making assumptions or missing user groups.
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                After talking to a few designers and professors, we realized the importance of crafting a safe and respectful environment to design in with our plugin. We wanted our plugin to not call out designers, but rather, bring their attention to potential considerations they should be aware of moving forward in the design process. This shifted the language and structure of our generated considerations in the final prototype.

                After talking to designers and explaining our high-level concept, we realized the core value of our Figma plugin was dependent on being able to parse through the user’s file.

            <div class="description">
                We soon decided we wanted the data collection process for our plugin to be two-pronged:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Users can input information such as research topic, problem statement, target user groups, implementation tools, and other high-level details of their UX research
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can also input demographic information of the designers working on the project and users being interviewed

            </div>
            <div class="description">
                All information was optional, making it so that the designer wouldn’t have to modify their Figma file nor compromise sensitive information in order to access insights from our plugin.
