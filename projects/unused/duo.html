                The goal of this project was to improve on one of Duolingo's current products. I chose Duolingo and decided to create a version of the language-learning app centered around Duo the Owl. Many people have probably played games like Talking Tom or Webkinz in which the objective is for an individual to keep an animal or pet alive by playing minigames. By introducing an animal or living being into a game, people become more emotionally tied, since there are no longer just points or streaks at stake. This was the driving concept behind Duo’s version of Duolingo--a more fun, interactive way to learn new languages.

                In December, I was sent a design challenge by Duolingo. I read the instructions a few times and began brainstorming. What products did Duolingo currently have? How could they be improved? I remembered using Duolingo growing up to practice my Spanish and explore some basic French. Since Duolingo was founded in Pittsburgh, everytime I fly into or out of Pittsburgh (where my college is based), I connect to wifi and am reminded of the fact that Duolingo sponsors the Pittsburgh International Airport wifi. I began thinking of ways to improve the app: make it points/challenge-based? Introduce a "player" to the game and make it an adventure game? I remembered one of the reasons why I stopped using Duolingo over time was that I'd just forget about my daily streaks. Sure, they mattered and it was nice to see that I'd been practicing my Spanish for the past, but I wasn't overly sad when my streak ended. 

                So, I decided to introduce Duo the Owl to the game. Duo would be this kind of main character for the player to play as. The goal? Keeping Duo alive on it's journey to greatness. Duo would have daily dependencies on warmth, food, energy, and/or sleep that could be fulfilled by the user completing their daily language challenges. If Duo ran out of any one of its key elements to survival, the user would essentially be reset to an earlier part of the journey (whilst maintaining their current progress on the language learning aspect of the app).

                The user, like before, is still able to select languages they want to learn and complete daily challenges from different lessons to help them learn that language, but now, they’re earning points to keep Duo on track to completing an adventure! Daily challenges might boost Duo’s warmth, food, energy, or sleep--all imperative to Duo’s survival! Users can view leaderboards, edit their profile, and see how well they’ve done in the current month (as shown in the profile page wireframe with the grid for October).

                This was one of my first times completing a design challenge for a company, and I had a lot of fun reimagining existing app concepts. I learned a lot on the ends of staying true to the company's brand and goals, which helped on the ends of redesigning the reimagined app, and also using my imagination and knowledge on design concepts to create something new and eventful. I thought back to what I personally experienced as a past user of the app--what did I like? What would I improve? Was the app easy to learn and easy to use? Did I want to use the app over time or just for a short while before I deleted it? Did I have fun learning new languages with this app? These were all questions I asked myself in the process of redesigning Duolingo. After all, language learning can be so much more fun with a companion like Duo the Owl to keep you company.
